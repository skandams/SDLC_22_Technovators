# Requirements

## Project overview
Calculations have been a vital part of mankind from years. The people in old era had no facilities like various calculators available now and so had to use pen paper for long and varied calculations. But, today is an era of TECHNOLOGY and CREATIVITY. As said by the renowed Sadhguruji that "Creation is indeed just a complex amalgamtion". Hence, here we present to you a project that aims at reducing your work of fidgeting from one app to other for when comes to various calculation and conversion techniques by amalgamation of various different calculators. This project presents the essential parameter/score from various different fields of calculations. The project helps you to perform normal arithmetic calculations and basic conversions along with scientific as well as electronic calculations.We also have a Medical Calculator and Bank Calculator which makes this a must to use platform. This can be further extended by adding more parameters as well as certain more medical facilities and combined to an app that every person wish would have with them.  

Medical technology is a field where rapid diagnostics and treatment at a large scale is essential and hence comes the requirement of MEDI-CALC. Given the ratio of doctors/medical proffessionals to people in our country, it is important that there is a system in place to give the required parameters for dignostics from test results. As a part of future extension, we can interact with the doctors and have a more specific diagnostic questions and parameters in the quizes so as to enhance the reliability of the medical calculator. For students and teenagers, this app is a boon as it can help them with the electronic as well as scientific calculation and also help them aware about their medical health. Not only that, their banking related calculations can also be captured making it an all rounder platform.
 
## Objectives:

1. To develop a one stop platform for all calculations.
2. Brainstorming and work division
3. Requirement/feature identification
4. Presenting the design using visualisation tools.
5. Implementing the project in c language.
5. Making the code more efficient, clean and portable.
6. Integration of software for the final application
7. Testing the code using various tools.
8. To work independently, yet contribute together as a whole.

## Features:
### 1. Medical Calculator


### 3. Electronic Calculator
1. Resistor Color code: The carbon composition resistors have 3 to 6 resistor color bands. The 3 - band resistor has three colors with multiplier and no tolerance. The three bands can be selected to know the resistor value. Whereas, the 4 band, 5 band, and 6 band resistors have an extra band known as tolerance.
2. Current and Voltage Division: The current divider is a simple circuit that provides an output current that is fraction of the input current . The voltage across a resistance is equal to the value of the ratio of resistance divided by equivalent. This rule is used to determine the value of the voltage in a divider circuit.
3. Series Circuit Analysis and Source transformation: Source transformation is a process of simplifying a circuit solution.
