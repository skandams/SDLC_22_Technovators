# Requirements
## Project overview
Medical technology is a field where rapid diagnostics and treatment at a large scale is essential.This is where the requirement of MEDI-CALC comes in. Given the ratio of doctors/medical proffessionals to people in our country,It is important that there is a system in place to give the required parameters for dignostics from test results.
 
## Objectives
1.Defining a requirement and develop an application for the same.
2.Brainstorming and work division
3.Requirement/feature identification
4. Presenting the design using visualisation tools.
5. Implementing the project in c language.
5. Making the code more efficient, clean and portable.
6.Integration of software for the final application
7.Testing the code using various tools.
